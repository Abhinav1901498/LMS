# Virtual Calculator using openCV

The Hand Gesture Calculator is an innovative project that combines computer vision and human–computer interaction using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. Instead of pressing physical keys, users can interact with a virtual calculator on their computer screen through hand gestures detected in real time via a webcam. The system tracks the tips of the index and middle fingers, allowing the user to “pinch” over a button to select it. Each button, such as numbers, operators, delete, clear, and equal, responds with a single click thanks to a delay mechanism that prevents multiple unintended inputs. The expression is displayed at the top of the interface and can be evaluated just like a normal calculator. This project demonstrates how AI-powered gesture recognition can replace traditional input devices and create a touchless, interactive experience with practical applications in virtual interfaces, accessibility tools, and futuristic computing systems
